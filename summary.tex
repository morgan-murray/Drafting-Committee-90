\section{Summary}

Beam-helicity and beam-charge asymmetries in the azimuthal distribution of real photons from leptoproduction on an unpolarised hydrogen target have been presented. These asymmetries were extracted from a new unpolarised hydrogen data set taken during the 2006 and 2007 operating periods of H{\sc ermes}. Analogous asymmetry amplitudes were extracted previously from hydrogen data obtained during the 1996-2005 experimental period as described in Ref.~\cite{Air09}. A comparison of the amplitudes extracted from these independent data sets has shown that they are compatible and the asymmetry amplitudes can therefore be extracted from the complete 1996-2007 event sample. \red{The asymmetry amplitudes extracted from the combined data set are the statistically most precise DVCS measurements presented by H{\sc ermes}. There is} a strong signal in the first harmonic of the interference contribution to the beam-helicity asymmetry. There are non-zero amplitudes in the zeroth and first harmonics of the beam-charge asymmetry. Each of the higher order asymmetry amplitudes is consistent with zero. The combined results are compared to calculations from ongoing work to fit GPD models to experimental data. All data amplitudes are also presented as projections in $-t$ in bins of $x_{\textrm{B}}$. No additional features are observed in any particular $x_{\textrm{B}}$-bin.
