++++++++++++++++ Comments to Draft 90, 1st circulation
++++++++++++++++++++ "Beam-helicity and charge asymmetries in the BH and
DVCS processes on an unpolarized proton target"
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ version 1.0
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ I congratulate the DC to a already
quite matured draft. It nicely presents the enormous data set without
too much repetition of DC69. Nevertheless, at the end I had to push the
red button as the analysis is not yet finished as we all know. The
incident with the shifted calo blocks shows how careful we have to be
when publishing a high-precission result, even more when attempting a
cross section comparison for two different beam charges. Do we really
trust our understanding of the detector, especially its stability, as
well as beam helicity balancing to state systematics on a per mille
level? 

YES, WE THINK SO. SEE SPECIFIC REPLIES.(AT NO POINT DO WE STATE THAT WE KNOW ANYTHING TO BETTER THAN 0.1%!)

In particular: - was anything done about trigger efficiencies? 

YES. SEE JB'S UPDATED RERELEASE TALK.

- only the uncertainty on the magnitude of the beam polarization is taken
into account, but extraction requires (after weighting of events) beam-
helicity balancing, e.g., the uncertainty on \int dL (|P^+| - |P^-|) (or
in other words: one needs to consider both the uncertainty on the
average and the difference of the beam polarizations of the two two
helicity states, which is more than just stating a scale uncertainty,
i.e., the uncertainty stemming from the average) 

WE DON'T PERFORM BEAM HELICITY BALANCING, INSTEAD WE WEIGHT THE FIT. IN THE FIT, THE BEAM POLARISATION IS AVERAGED YEAR-ON-YEAR. ONE WHOULD EXPECT THAT ANY STOCHASTIC FLUCTUATION IN THE BEAM POLARISATION WOULD BE AVERAGED OUT IN THIS PROCESS, LEAVING ONLY THE SCALE UNCERTAINTY AS A RELEVANT VALUE FOR QUOTATIONS. SEE JB'S RERELEASE TALK.

How sensitive is the
fit to slight imbalances of the two beam-helicity states?

WE DON'T BALANCE BEAM HELICITY, SO THIS QUESTION IS NOT APPLICABLE. SEE PREVIOUS REPLY.

 - when going to the new event-selection and amplitude-extration method (no strict
exclusivity cut and, I guess, kinematic fitting?) will we do this for
all years, or only 2006 and 2007? What will be done with the systematics
coming from the missing-mass shift? 

COVERED IN ANALYSIS TALK.

I assume it also has to be re-evaluated? - what about the photon-energy correction: what is used there now? 

SEE RELEASE TALK

- handling of systematics: take, e.g., systematics on A_LU,DVCS^s1: it's 0.001 for combined data set but 0.008 and 0.004 for
06/07 and 96/05 data sets, respectively. How can it be so much smaller?
Which systematics from the two years cancelled each other? OR A_C^c0:
0.005 for 96/07 but 0.008 for both separate data sets OR A_C^c1: 0.014
so much larger than for c0 term even though, I believe that the constant
term is more difficult than the cosphi term; and here one has the
opposite trend: the combined data has a worse uncertainty than the
single data sets ... I am not saying such behavior is impossible, but I
would feel better if I understood the (non-)cancelation effects 

THE CHANGE IS DUE TO SHIFTS IN THE MISSING MASS DISTRIBUTION AND THE TWO ACCEPTANCES IN THE DATASET. THE CANCELLATION IS A 'FORTUNATE' OCCURRENCE, IT MAY JUST AS EASILY HAVE GONE THE OTHER WAY. WE SEE NO OTHER WAY TO DEAL WITH THE SYSTEMATICS AT PRESENT.

COMMENTS: Main itema: 

1) In many sections of the draft you point out
that you can combine the data recorded in the years 1996--2005 and
2006--2007. In my point of view you should re- write the publication to
present the 1996--2007 data, i.e.: 


1.1) You should not address the data compatibility neither in the abstract nor in the conclusion. 

WE DISAGREE

1.2) You should not include figures 2 and 3 showing the asymmetries extracted
from the 1996--2005 or 2006--2007 data (if you include the figures than
show the error bands as in figures 4 and 5 to give the reader a fair
chance for a compatibility check). 

WE DISAGREE.

1.3) But you should convince the
reader that the data is compatible, i.e.: - you should mention which
statistical test you have used (and not just a statistical test as in
line 513) - you should state confidence level for the (dis)agreement
(with and without systematic uncertainties which can be anti-correlated
for the 1996--2005 and 2006-- 2007 data taking periods). - you should
also state confidence levels for the kinematics and not only for the
asymmetries (it is very important that the kinematic values agree even
though there is no strong dependence for your results) 

WE DISAGREE. THE READER SHOULD SHOW SOME TRUST TO THE WRITER THAT HE HAS DONE THIS WORK AND IT IS REASONABLE. THE DATA YOU TALK ABOUT WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE TO ANY REFEREE BUT WILL NOT BE PUT INTO THE FINAL PUBLICATION.


1.4) You should
include the data taking period 1996--2005 in section 2 and describe the
chances in the experimental setup (which beam charge in which year,
average beam polarization etc.). The reader will appreciate quantitative
statements and might be lost with statements such as "the beam
polarization was lower in 2006 and 2007" (line 555--556). 

DISAGREE. 96-05 DATA IS COVERED ADEQUATELY IN PREVIOUS PUBLICATIONS.

2) I understand that your asymmetries are related to Compton form factors
that are related to GPD convoluted with a hard scattering kernel. But
apart from providing input to phenomenologists, we should give a physics
message. You quote that you have three times more events than the
original publication [7]. But there is not more information about GDP
revealed in your draft than in reference [7]. So please be more precise
here. 

IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO LINK TO GPDS FROM ASYMMETRIES DIRECTLY IN A SIMPLE MANNER. THIS IS A COMPLICATED PROCEDURE AND INTERESTED READERS SHOULD READ MULLER/LIUTI PAPERS FOR BETTER INFORMATION THAT WE CAN PROVIDE.


3) The latest DVSC publications are very similar w.r.t. text. I
understand that you are not interested in reinventing the wheel, but
there is some potential for changes: 3.1) After the introduction's first
sentence you could mention what we learn from GDP. 3.2) You should skip
"Although GDP are difficult to access experimentally". It is up to the
reader to decide how difficult the measurement of Compton form factors
is compared to the study of the helicity distributions for strange
quarks or gluons or the analysis of the quark flavor asymmetry in the
nucleon (to give examples for familiar PDF). 3.3) The awesome jargon
cluster "Each CFF is a convolution of a hard scattering kernel with a
GDP that describes a soft part of the scattering process" might be worth
disentangling (i.e. explain in more sentences). 3.4) In line 165 you
could give the precise formula for the skewness variable. 3.5) The
remark in lines 168-169 (skewness variable as observable) should be
included in the results chapter. 3.6) The caption of figure 1 should be
changed. Please be very short or describe both processes in about the
same detail. As there might be higher order contributions, you should be
careful with the general description of the DVCS process. 

THERE ARE MANY THINGS THAT WE COULD DO, BUT TO IMPLEMENT MANY OF THESE SUGGESTIONS WOULD PROVIDE TOO MUCH THEORETICAL DETAIL NOT SUITABLE FOR AN EXPERIMENTAL PAPER OR REPEAT INFORMATION THAT IS EXPLAINED ELSEWHERE. WE HAVE EXPANDED THE DESCRIPTION OF BH IN THE CAPTION TO FIGURE 1.

4) The eye should be pleased as well. So please improve the layout of the
publication: 

4.1) Please align all formula. DONE BY THE JOURNAL 

4.2) Please use in text mode A = B / C instead of A = \frac{B}{C}. DISAGREE 

4.3) Please reduce the number of page breaks. DONE BY THE JOURNAL 

4.4) Please improve the plots (thicker error bars, both the data points and its error should be visible in every bin (e.g. figure's 5 t-dependence for cos(2phi)), the symbols and also to text are too small (e.g. figure 7) FIGURE 7 IS UPDATED.

4.5) Please include tables 3 - 5 only in the HepData database or use landscape format here. 

DISAGREE

5) Last but not least: Please choose a more catchy title (as, e.g. reference [7]). also no jargon.

WITHOUT A SUGGESTION, WE PREFER TO KEEP THE TITLE AS IT IS.

F. Ellinghaus [Frank.Ellinghaus@desy.de] reject DATE: 2011.04.25 

Dear All, sorry for that red button, but I'm totally surprised by the final results and thus I guess I'm questioning the analysis. 

PLEASE SEE EXTRA RELEASE TALK.

Basically, the results get worse when you combine the 1996-2005 and the 2006/07 data, when compared to the 2006/07 data alone. This is due to a dramatic increase in the systematic uncertainty, see, e.g., ALUI-sinphi (0.026 -> 0.047) or AC-cosphi (0.003 -> 0.014) in tables 3-6. This cannot happen as the results are in agreement (i.e., there is no error inflation in order to release tension between results.) Basically, by adding information your result cannot get worse if the combination is done the right/best way. 

SYSTEMATIC UNCERTAINTY FOR NEW RESULTS WAS DONE USING A DIFFERENT GENERATOR AND A DIFFERENT GEOMETRY WIN THE MC. IT'S PERFECTLY REASONABLE FOR THE SYSTEMATIC ERROR TO GET WORSE WHEN ADDING TWO DIFFERENT RESULTS, IN FACT IT IS EXPECTED. IT WOULD BE UNREASONABLE IF THE STATISTICAL ERROR WERE TO WORSEN, BUT THAT DID NOT HAPPEN.

Unfortunately it is not stated at all in the paper how the combination is done. What you should do is to add the stat and the uncorrelated (between the two periods) sys errors in quadrature separately for the two periods. Based on this uncertainty you should do a weighted average of two results. 

THIS IS MORE OR LESS WHAT WE HAVE.

Or did you do a full re-analysis of the 1996-2005 data? This should not be done unless you have new improved techniques (I don't think there are any) or you have not enough information on the old data in order to do a combination (which also should not be the case I think). 

WE DID NOT CHANGE ANY ANALYSIS DETAILSREGARDING 96-05 DATA. IN THE ANALYSIS FOR THIS 1.0 VERSION OF THE PAPER, THE SYSTEMATICS WERE CALCULATED BY ADDING THE UNCORRELATED MISSING MASS AND BACKGROUND FRACTIONS AND THE MC WAS A MIX IF EVENTS EXTRACTED WITH THE TWO DIFFERENT GENERATORS AND GEOMETRIES. THE CURRENT VERSION OF THE PAPER SIMPLIFIES THIS; WE SIMPLY EXTRACT MC SYSTEMATICS FROM THE DUAL GENERATOR AND PRERECOIL GEOMETRY (NO DUAL GENERATOR AVAILABLE FOR POST-RECOIL GEOMETRY) AS AGREED WITH COLLABORATION AT RELEASE TALK.

Anyhow, also with a full new analysis the additional data should not make the result worse. The paper is nice, but given that all but the result chapter are basically copy&paste of the 1996-2005 paper, I wonder if you have discussed to make all of this much shorter by simply citing the old paper and maybe submit the shortened version to PRD-rapid instead? That would set it apart some more. Table 3 and table 4 should be removed once the combined result is better than the one from 2006/2007 alone..... 

THIS PAPER IS IMPROVED OVER DC69 IN SEVERAL WAYS. THE EQUATIONS ARE RECHECKED AND THE RELATIVE SUPPRESSIONS OF THE AMPLITUDES ARE CLARIFIED. DIAGREE THAT WE SHOULD GIVE LESS DATA ON PRINCIPLE. SINCE THIS IS ONE IN A SERIES OF PAPERS IN JHEP, IT HAS BEEN DECIDED TO CONTINUE PUBLISHING THERE.

One more question: In line 267 it is said that "the procedure to select events is similar to the one" for the 1996-2005 data. Where does the event selection differ? I think it should be the same except you have a very good reason, and you will need to discuss the impact of this change, otherwise one does not know how to interpret all the figures with both sets of results shown. I was not able to find the difference in the event selection.... Cheers, Frank 

MISSING MASS EVENT SELECTION IS DIFFERENT BECAUSE THE MISSING MASS SHIFT HAS TO BE TAILORED BETWEEN DATA SETS. THIS IS MORE OR LESS THE ONLY CHANGE.

Congratulations on this very well written paper! I have only a few
comments. -my affiliation is Gent

SORRY! IS FIXED NOW

005 replace ?Charge? by ?Beam-Charge? as it is used later everywhere in the
text 077 ditto

AGREED

007 you write out Bethe--Heitler
(use two hyphens!) but not DVCS, isn't that inconsistent? 

DVCS IS A VERY COMMON INITIALISM FOR THE PROCESS, WHEREAS BH ISN'T. WRITING OUT DVCS WOULD LEAD TO A 4-LINE TITLE, WHICH WOULD BE TOO LONG.

--------------------
Fig.1 caption: make a distinction
between (a) and (b) figure labels and the (e), (p), ... symbols for
particles. Add a comments the Bethe-Heitler radiation can be from
scattered electron as well.

Figure 1: there are two
more diagrams contributing (cf. DC69)

Figure 1: we would prefer to add also the BH
FSR diagram.

WE HAVE ADDED THE DC69 FIGURE VERSION INSTEAD

--------------------

fig1:
move figure 1 to the bottom of the page.

IN GENERAL, FIGURES ARE AT THE TOP OF THE PAGE. THIS WILL BE DECIDED BY THE JOURNAL IN THE FINAL RECKONING

Table 1: I would prefer to write "1" instead of "--" for the
unsupressed contributions. The text states AC^cos(0phi) undergoes a
kinematic suppression, but ths does not appear in the Table.

WILL ADD DETAIL OF KINEMATIC SUPPRESSION.

Eq 1.7: add a comma before and

OK

Fig. 2, 3, ... is it possible to align
numbers according to their decimal points? (vertical axis)

CAN ADD 0.0 TO AXIS? DONE.

---------------
Table 2 (435): total systematic uncertainty 0.006

Table 2 Why is the total systematic
uncertainty written twice here (in the 2nd and 6th columns)? Also, it is
given as both 0.05 and 0.06 for A_LU,I^sin2phi

Tab. 2:
Are the delta_syst values in the 2nd column and the last column
redundant information?

Table 2. Syst uncertainty for
ALU,I^{sin2\phi} is different from the one in Table 3.

RE: 0.005 & 0.006 WHOOPS! GOOD SPOT! WAS A TYPO. WE HAVE REMOVED THE DOUBLE-ENTRY
----------------

Figs 2 & 3: The key is somewhat unclear. The
2006-2006 points are "this work"? The reference is "1996-2005 HERMES
data"?

YES. WE HAVE CHANGED THIS.

Are figs. 2 and 3 really necessary?

YES.

Figs 4 & 5: Are these just replotting of Fig 2 & 3 with curves
and combining the data sets? If so, it could be argued that Figs. 2 & 3
are not needed.

THEY'RE HERE TO SHOW THE EFFECT FROM CHANGING THE ACCEPTANCE (SLIGHTLY). THEY ARE NOT STRICTLY NECESSARY BUT THEY ARE NICE-TO-SEE FOR THE READER.

Eq. 3.3: do you really
add all this sin\nphi terms ? If yes the sentence at 304 is not true
(not all the sin\phi terms are physically motivated).

GOOD SPOT. THE EQN. WAS INCORRECT.

Tables 3-6 - col. 2,3,4: these are
<-t>, <xB>, and <Q2> - col. 1: Q2 and -t ranges need units -?-> adopt
DC69 style? 

YES.

Fig.4: the curves of
Liuti's predictions are too light to be well visible. In the first row
the ystematic band looks odd when comparing the -t projection versus the
rest.

DARKENED LIUTI'S CURVES. THE T-PROJECTION SYSTEMATICS ARE DRIVEN BY THE GOOD T-RESOLUTION COMPARED TO THE (POORER) SMALL-XBJ RESOLUTION. WE CHECKED THE CALCULATIONS. 

fig4,5 The crosses by Guidal should be lines as
usually done for theory models

NO, BECAUSE THE GUIDAL POINTS ARE NOT THEORY MODELS, RATHER EXTRACTIONS OF CFFS AT CERTAIN POINTS FROM DATA THAT SHOULD NOT NECESSARILY BE INTERPOLATED AND NEVER EXTRAPOLATED. HOWEVER, WE WILL REMOVE THESE POINTS AS THEY ARE UNPUBLISHED AND MICHEL PREFERS TO PRESENT THEM FOR THE FIRST TIME HIMSELF.

Figure 5: do we see the kinematic suppression of AC^cos(0phi) with
respect AC^cos(phi) we describe in the text, having the best achivable
statistics at HERMES ? How big is the expected suppression ?  Is
this related to the additional k factor ? 

NOT CALCULABLE. THE 'C-FUNCTION' UNDERLYING THE CO-EFFICIENT IS A FUNCTION OF 'Y' THAT IS DETERMINED ON THE EVENT LEVEL, SO WE CANNOT SIMPLY CALCULATE THE 'K' VALUE FOR EACH BIN AND CHECK THAT IT MATCHES THE THEORETICAL EXPECTATION.


-----------------
Fig.6 and 7: update the layout
to be more similar to the previous figures, since the data-points are
too small, expecially in Figure 7.

Figs 6 and 7 - data tables are
missing - maybe put xB ranges on top of plot - use same font size for
horizontal and vertical axes - include assoc. fraction (maybe only in
tables to be provided) - use bigger symbols (same as in previous figs.)
- horizontal axis label should be centered - make plots transparent (and
thus solve the problem of losing the "1" on the "10"s of the 2nd and 3rd
column axis labels -


Figures 6 and 7: please adapt the dot sizes to the other
figures!

Fig 7: - align vertical axis labels and then don't
crop part of them as, e.g., in cos(3phi) - labels should be further away
from plot than numbers


Figure 7: something wrong with middle panel 0^-2 ->
10^-2

Figure 7 these symbols are much too small and should be increased
substantially horizontal axis: ?0^2? should read ?10^-2? (twice)

AGREED
----------------

Fig. 7 any explanation of the large systematics of the last
t bin in the first xB range?

THEY'RE DRIVEN BY THE RESOLUTION OF THE SPECTROMETER COMING FROM MC STUDIES.


Fig.7: the y axis range in A_C^cos phi plot can be
slightly expanded from -0.3 to 0.2

DISAGREE, ALL SCALES IN THE AMPLITUDES ARE KEPT THE SAME DELIBERATELY.

- author list
will need an update (e.g., missing "Now at" etc.) and I hope we will use
a style consistent with previous HERMES JHEP publications, e.g., DC69.
(cf. the wiki entry for HERMES author lists) 

THE AUTHOR LIST WILL BE TAKEN FROM THE OFFICIAL LIST GENERATED BY NAOMI. THE JHEP TITLE STYLE ENCOURAGES AUTHORS TO USE THEIR LOGO; WE'RE OF THE OPINION TO FOLLOW THE JOURNAL GUIDELINES.

DISAGREE

084-086: "most precise asymmetry amplitude measurements
available in the HERMES kinematic region." Of course this is a true
statement, why else would we pb publishing it?

WE COULD BE PUBLISHING THE 06-07 MEASUREMENTS SEPARATELY - A NEW RESULT WOTH PUBLISHING BUT NOT NECESSARILY MORE PRECISE.

084 shouldn?t there be
a hyphen after ?asymmetry??

NO.

148 -> Bethe--Heitler (please change it throughout the manuscript)

AGREED

152-155: I understand this is the last paper
of a series, but this single sentence is too short as a motivation of
the study.

DONE

152 I would prefer to not use
capitalized words when they are generally not capitalized, e.g.,
"parton", "distribution" etc. If you still like to do so, please be
consistent and do it everywhere, e.g., also at the end of this line

WE CAPITALISED PARTON DISTRIBUTION FUNCTIONS.

154 I don't understand the logic/flow here: "Although GPDs are difficult to
access ..., ... HERMES ... published results on " DVCS. Wouldn't it be
more helpful to comment on why they are difficult to access and that
DVCS is one way to do so? And then one could list the published results
and as this is a community-wide effort I would restrain from listing
only HERMES (in the Introduction!), but all experiments. (Otherwise it
might read like, yeah it's difficult to access but HERMES (and only
HERMES) can do it.")

WE ARE TREADING A BALANCE BETWEEN TWO CAMPS: SOME PEOPLE WANT A VERY QUICK UPDATE PAPER AND SOME WOULD PREFER SOMETHING MORE THOROUGH. WE WOULD BE CRITICISED FOR INCLUDING TOO MUCH 'OVERVIEW' INFORMATION. NEVERTHELESS, YOUR ADVICE IS VALID AND WE WILL ADD AN EXTRA SENTENCE, MAYBE TWO.

157 Form Factors -?-> form factors

THIS IS TO INDICATE WHERE THE INTIALISM CFF COMES FROM.

157-159: skip
"via Compton Form Factors (CFFs). Each ... process." Don't need to be so
specific here. This point is covered later. 

WE ALREADY DESCRIBE GPDS EARLIER IN THE PARAGRAPH AND WANT TO PROVIDE SOME BASIC INTUITIVE HANDLE ON THEM HERE. ALTHOUGH IT IS REPEATED LATER, IT IS WORTHWHILE TO GIVE THE READER A MENTAL 'HOOK' ON THE IDEA HERE, WE FEEL.

158: *calculable* hard scattering kernel

THIS INFORMATION IS ALREADY IMPLIED BY 'HARD'.


-------------
158 "a" -> "the" (as far as I can see from Fig. 1 there is only one soft part in each diagram). Anyway, also this is a bit vague: what is "that" referring to?
To "a GPD"? The scattering process can be influenced by more than one
GPD (cf. Eq. 3.7), while each CFF involves one GPD only.

YES, YOU UNDERSTOOD THE MEANING PRECISELY. THEREFORE, IT CANNOT BE THAT VAGUEÉAND NOBODY ELSE SEEMED TO HAVE A PROBLEM.

158: replace "a soft part"
with "the soft part"

SEE COMMENT ABOVE. SEVERAL GPDS DESCRIBE THE ENTIRE SOFT PART OF THE PROCESS, THEREFORE EACH GPD ONLY DESCRIBES A PART OF THE PROCESS.

------------
171-172: "experimentally indistinguishable" -> rephrase, they are
somehow distinguishable otherwise we cannot measure the DVCS ...

171 This statement and figure are not fully correct,
given that the start of the sentence suggests that you talk about
general leptoproduction. First of all in fig. 1b there can be a photon
line also on e', and on p and p'. The latter are almost always left out,
but formally they are present (and they are not completely negligible,
see PRC64 (2001) 054610). And in fig1a there should be a blob with
'legs': p, gamma*, p', and gamma. What happens within the blob requires
a model. Only under the conditions of deep-inelastic production the
given diagram may apply (and even then as leading term only). Finally
all this is up to and including 2nd order in alpha only.

171: I don't think you really mean what is written here, that is that
either DVCS or BH describe the observed process completely. Rather you
coul try saying "Leptoproduction of real photons (ep->e'p'gamma) arises
from two experimentally indistinguishable . . ."

REPHRASED

172 "a quark" - it's not just "a" quark but the active quark

176 For the calculation of BH, the elastic form factors of
the nucleon are needed. We feel that this piece of information is
missing here.

YOU NEED THE ELASTIC FORM FACTORS TO CALCULATE ALL THE COEFFICIENTS IN EQNS. 1.3 AND 1.4. THIS IS DETAIL THAT DOESN'T HELP THE READER TOO MUCH AND WE GIVE A REFERENCE WHERE ONE CAN DISCOVER THE INFORMATION VERY EASILY.

178: to --> into

178: ... amplitude in the interference ...

NO

178 amplifies
the (small) DVCS amplitude in the interference term

WE ALREADY SAY THAT BH DOMINATES.

178 "amplifies the contribution of the DVCS amplitude"
lead to confusion. Part of the confusion was caused by the interference
term not being given explicitly in terms of tau_BH and tau_DVCS. Could
this be added?

WE'LL ADD IT IN 1.2

179: remove the
word "useful"

NO - ONE CAN CONSTRAIN GPDS E.G. FROM OUR MEASUREMENT OF F2 AS WELL, BUT NOT USEFULLY. WE'RE POINTING OUT HERE THAT THE INTERFERENCE TERM IS ONE OF THE MORE USEFUL RESULTS EXTRACTED AT HERMES FOR THE CONSTRAINT OF GPDS.

214-218: skip whole sentence ("In orde to... following
asymmetries:") and simply write: "These can be expressed respectively
as:"

AGREED

Eq. 1.6-1.8: to simplify
the text, you can put a simbol for the denominator and explicit it as
additional equation.

DISAGREE

--------
eqs 1.6-8 separate lines
with large fractions with more vertical space to facilitate the
readability of these equations.


230: leave more space between the two lines of eq. 1.7

DONE.
--------

242-243: I would prefer to keep the same symbol
(with two superscripts) and write the first superscript refers to the
charge of the beam and the second to ....

WE PREFER THE CURRENT VERSION

243 "beam spin ..." -> "positive
(negative) beam helicity" 

NO, BEAM SPIN PROJECTED ON THE MOMENTUM AXIS IS (FRAME DEPENDENT) HELICITY. PROJECTING HELICITY ONTO THE MOMENTUM DIRECTION IS NONSENSICAL!

---------
245 the "additional" here is a bit lost. I
would once again mention Ref. 7. In any way, this paper reports first
the independent data set of 2006 and 2007 and then results from the
total data set. Suggestion: This article reports on the analysis of the
data set taken during 2006 and 2007, after the HERMES experiment was
upgraded in the target region. The results do not make use of any of the
... equipment, e.g., a missing-mass technique for event selection is
used. In addition, results of the largest DVCS data set on unpolarized
protons to be published by HERMES, i.e., the combined data of Ref. 7 and
of these new 2006 and 2007 data, will be reported.

245 here, (comma)

245: "additionally,larger" an
"independent" should refer to something.

245
Compared to ... the analysis presented here includes ...

245: Begin
with: "Compared to the results previously published in Ref. [7], the
analysis presented here ..."

245 You need to mention the 96-05 data
here, otherwise "larger" has no meaning.

CHANGED
--------
246: add comma after "2007"

DISAGREE

247 Why not, if
it is available? Give some argument, please.

247-248: Since the
upgrade of the target region was not used, I would not bother to mention
it.

248 - The
phrase 'upgraded detector equipment' is rather vague. Why not say
without the use of detection of the recoil proton?

CHANGED THE PHRASING SLIGHTLY.
---------

249: "that will
be published by HERMES" -> "available at HERMES"

DISAGREE
------------

261 data were collected from 1996 until 2007! So either like: "The additional data to Ref. 7 were collected in 2006 and 2007 with the HERMES spectrometer ..."
or "The data were collected during the 1996-2007 data-taking periods, of
which only the 2006 and 2007 data is new compared to Ref. 7." (Or
something similar.)

Line 261 "The

CHANGED
-------

-line 266 , we think the Thomas
Thesis we refer here for polarimeters is not correct one and our
suggestion is to cite Thomas Thesis after luminosity numbers and for
Polarimeters cite usual TPOL (D. Barber et al ...) and LPOL(...M.
Beckmann et al....)

AGREED

--------
268 You should not give orders to the reader. I propose to
write ?more details can be found in refs. [16, 17]?

268:
'consult' seems a little harsch. How about 'more details can be found in
Refs.[16,17]'?

DISAGREE.
--------

268 An event was selected as having ... ---> An event was
defined as having ...

NO, IT WAS SELECTED THAT WAY.

269: are we going to keep this
"one photon" criterium ? Or you run over the new productions, where the
problem of fake photons should be fixed, or you should release this
requirement to improve the time-dependence systematics.

NO, THIS WAS WRITTEN BEFORE THE MULTI-PHOTON ALGORITHM WAS DEVELOPED!SEE RELEASE TALK AND 2ND CIRC.

269-274:
although you refer to other paper for details, it would be nice for the
reader to give a motivation for the cuts at least for the ones specific
to this analysis.

CAUGHT BETWEEN TWO CONFLICTING DESIRES: SHORT PAPER AS AN UPDATE OR LONG PAPER WITH EVERYTHING DETAILED. THESE CUTS ARE THE EASIEST TO REFERENCE AWAY, SO WE DO SO.

269 I believe that is going to change, i.e., no strict
exclusivity cut any longer

SEE NEW VERSION.

269: Could you explain a bit more of what defined "one photon" and
"one lepton" events? The paper, as presented, assumes that all readers
accept that HERMES does this correctly--true, but either some words
about this or a reference to how this is done is needed.

"CONSULT 16, 17 FOR MORE DETAILS."

269: "An event was selected as having...spectrometer." ->
"Only events having ...spectrometer were selected."

WHY?

270 does it make sense to also mention the t
range covered?

YES IT DOES. CHANGED.

271: why do you need
an upper cut on Q2 (Q2<10 GeV2)?

TO DEFINE A KINEMATIC BOUNDARY IS ALL. THIS LOSES BASICALLY NO EVENTS.

272: ... and real photon was required ...

DISAGREE

273 I would also mention that photons nearly collinear to
the scattered lepton were excluded. (as far as I remember)

DISAGREE

273 to be within the limits ---> to lie within the
limits

DISAGREE

275-283 & 398-406 Similar as in draft 91 it is mentioned that the peak/region in M_X^2 for positrons and electrons is shifted by 0.17 GeV^2, and now, in addition, there is a time dependent shift in the 2007 data set. The shift is taken
into account in the systematic error, but no hint whatsoever as to its
possible origin is given (energy/momentum calibrations of detector
parts, misalignments, physics???). Such an hint would be most welcome.

FIXED NOW

275: "An event sample ... requiring" ->
"The event sample was further selected by requiring"

DISAGREE

275:
replace "using a missing-mass" with "using the missing-mass"

DISAGREE

276: "measurement
corresponded" -> "process corresponds"

NO, A PROCESS DOESN'T HAVE A MISSING MASS. A MEASUREMENT DOES.

-line 277 we are wondering that the missing mass
resolution we put only on Calorimeter, is it true and are we sure that
Spectrometer Momentum and Beam momentum uncertainties doesn't
contribute??? Ate least for Mx2 position shift we are discussing that
Beam energy uncertainty could play a role(see last DVCS list for
discussions)

YES, UNLESS THERE'S SOME OTHER INDICATION THAT BEAM MOMENTUM UNCERTAINTY IS VERY MUCH HIGHER THAN WE HAVE SEEN.

277: A picture
is worth a thousand words Here a missing mass plot with the cut shown
would be useful (or a reference to such a plot).

CAN BE FOUND IN DC69 (SEE 16, 17 FOR MORE DETAILS)

278 q and p are
already defined in 161 and 166. Here you only need to define q?

SURE, BUT IT'S NICER TO DEFINE THEM ALL SO THERE'S NO CONFUSION.

279: you should motivate why the mass window is
asimmetric with respect the proton mass.

CONSULT 16,17 FOR MORE DETAILS

280-283: the sentence is not
clear. At miminum: shifted in specific time-intervals... differences in
the missing-mass distributions of the electron...

THIS IS NO LONGER DONE.

-line 280-283, please specify a bit in detail or in
systematics section, exactly for which period(how much in pb-1 it makes)
Mx2 was shifted, from text its difficult to get it.

THIS IS NO LONGER DONE.

280 Even if it is understood what is meant, the formula is incorrect, as
it says 2.25 < Mx2 < 2.89.

AGREED.

differences"

292: I am not sure the word
"expanded" is the right choice here.

WE ARE.

303: .. Fourier series in the
azimuthal dependencies of the ...

NOPE.

303 - I do not
understand 'truncation of the infinite series caused by the azimuthal
dependencies in the denominator..' Can the text be made more explicit?

DIVISION OF TWO FOURIER SERIES CAN LEAD TO 'FALSE' HARMONICS ARISING. WE CUT THOSE OFF. WE IMPROVED THE TEXT.

303: "infinite Fourier series" -> "Fourier series." then
skip "caused ... Eqs. 1.6-1.8."

DISAGREE

304 dependencies -> dependences

AGREE

304 - 308 "extraneous harmonics caused by the denominators".Denominators
in Eqs. 1.6-1.8 are even functions of \phi (included propagators) , I
guess they can not produce cos[sin] harmonics in ALU[Ac] asymmetries.
Then, does it make sense to mention that the consistency check
amplitudes might have small non-zero values due to the normalization
uncertainty?

YES, WE PHRASED THIS BADLY. IS NOW REPHRASED. HOWEVER, WE STILL ONLY FIT WITH PHYSICS-MOTIVATED ASYMMETRIES - WE ASSUME THAT THE POTENTIAL (SMALL) NORMALIZATION UNCERTAINTY IS INCLUDED WITH THE STATISTICAL UNCERTAINTY - PREVIOUS STUDIES ON FIT STABILITY FROM VARIOUS THESES SUGGEST THIS.


304:
replace "from Eqs." with "of Eqs."

AGREE

308: some of these terms are also
expected to be zero not just small if the normalizations are handled
correctly.

DISAGREE. DUE TO EXPERIMENTAL UNCERTAINTIES, IT IS HIGHLY, HIGHLY UNLIKELY THAT YOU EXTRACT EXACTLY 0.00000 FROM A HARMONIC IN A FIT TO DATA. THESE TERMS *SHOULD* BE ZERO, BUT ARE MERELY EXPECTED TO BE COMPATIBLE WITH ZERO WITHIN STATISTICAL UNCERTAINTIES ARISING FROM 'IMPERFECT' INPUT TO THE FIT ARISING FROM MEASUREMENT UNCERTAINTIES.

308: "small" means nothing. Say, e.g.
"consistent with zero"

OK.

310 comma before "and"

NO.

312: "Weight are introduced per event in ..." ->
"Event weights are introduces in ..."

AGREE

315: actually it
is c_n^I, the others c_n enter only in the denominator.

YES, AGREE.

316: what do you
mean by "may also be affected" ? The asymmetry amplitude is surely
affected. Maybe you mean in a not negligible way ?

YES, THAT'S WHAT WE MEAN

317: ... denominators of Eqs. ...

DISAGREE

317: Replace ". . .
complex Compton Form Factors. A CFF is . . ." with ". . . complex
Compton Form Factors (CFF). A CFF is . . ." Thus defining CFF.

YES, CHANGED

318 Form Factors -> form factors

DISAGREE

318 delete "A CFF ..." as it is repetition
of 157

DISAGREE - NECESSARY TO KEEP SENTENCES A MANAGEABLE LENGTH

318: A reference is needed
to tell the reader where this C-functions are defined.

AGREE

318:
"C-functions" which are combinations of complex Compton ... 

DISAGREE

318: "is a specific combination"

DISAGREE

318 explicitly define (CFF) at
the end of this sentence.

AGREED

318/19: delete sentence "A CFF is a
convolution .." it is a repetition of sentence in line 158

THIS IS STILL NECESSARY TO RELINK CFFS WITH GPDS. IN THIS SPECIFIC CASE, WE ARE WILLING TO SACRIFICE BREVITY FOR NARRATIVE EASE.

-------------------
320: delete
"relatively" it is superfluous

320: remove the word "relatively"

NOT SUPERFLUOUS. INDICATES THAT THE CONTRIBUTION OF GPDS TO CROSS-SECTION IS SURPRESSED RELATIVE TO THE OTHER GPDS, NOT NECESSARILY ALL GPDS.
--------------------

321: .. The access of each ...

DISAGREE

321-323: skip whole sentence: "The access ... is twist-2."

DISAGREE

327: from what I
understand also AC^cos(0phi) is leading twist, although kinematically
supressed. 

WILL ADD THIS TO THE TABLE

--------
327: "At
HERMES kinematic conditions" -> "At HERMES kinematics"

327, 368 kinematic conditions ---> kinematics

327: "At HERMES kinematic conditions" is
colloquial and should be rewritten. Appears at several other places.


NO, "AT HERMES KINEMATICS" IS COLLOQUIAL. IF NO SUGGESTION FORTHCOMING, WILL LEAVE AS IS.
-------

328 Inconsistent with 601.

NO. "LEADING", NOT "LEADING-TWIST".

---------
329: ... to the

329: "repsectively

DISAGREE. SINCE WE SPECIFY WHICH, WE CAN SKIP THE ARTICLE.
---------

329: skip "for an
unpolarized target" (already clear from UT indices)

DISAGREE

330 up to now in the paper those Fourier coefficients were
without subscript "unp" - need to decide whether to be conform to DC69
or to keep in mind DC80 (which is less relevant here)

MADE UNP TO KEEP CONSISTENCY WITH BMK!

339 -> so the k factor should cancel in the
ratio

EXISTS DUE TO THE DVCS TERM IN THE DENOMINATOR

339 Is it t or t'
in this formula for k? I thought that it was t', but as the difference
is small, most times t is used.

IT IS DELTA2, I.E. -t.

340: add "as" before Eq 3.7

DISAGREE

344: too many "respectively" just remove them
in both lines

DISAGREE

353 table 1: the last column represents
a RELATIVE Suppression, for which one expects a dimensionless number or
quantity. Hoever, 1/Q clearly has a dimension. Moreover, some columns
have a hyphen as entry. What would that mean 1 or 0?

HYPHEN IS STANDARD 'NO ENTRY' TERMINOLOGY. RELATIVE SUPPRESSION CAN OF COURSE HAVE A UNIT IF SOMETHING IS SUPPRESSED TO SOMETHING ELSE DUE TO A KINEMATIC PREFACTOR AS IS THE CASE HERE!!!

--------
354: the
*relative* suppression

354: "suppression factor"

CHANGED

be neglected in first approximation with respect to..."

AGREE

361: "determined
solely by the CFF H, and therefore by the GPD H"

DISGAREE

361: "Using this
dependence, H" -> "Therefore, the GPD H"

CHANGED

364: only at 602 we explain the kinematic
suppression of c0^I in words. Better anticipate here with a formula like
3.5/3.6.

AGREED

368: "HERMES kinematic
conditions" -> "HERMES kinematics"

DISAGREE

368-369: speaking about specific coefficients, the sentence
results indirect and therefore unclear (what does make the s1^DVCS
coefficient small?). Better remind the DVCS amplitude is much smaller
than BH in our kinematic regime and that ALU,DVCS^sin(phi) is higher
twist.

ADDED "TWIST-3" TO "THIS AMPLITUDE"

---------
370: replace "will be" by "is"

370: "will be" -> "is"

OK
---------

371: "extract
... of GPDs from" -> "contrain GPDs from"

DISAGREE - ONE CAN CONSTRAIN GPDS FROM THIS INFORMATION, JUST NOT USEFULLY.

371 for the
constraint of ---> to constrain

AGREED.

373 - It would be helpful to be more explicit about the C^I_T<unp
function here. I researched older HERMES papers to find that it is the
Compton FF corresponding to gluon transversity. It would be useful to
state that.

DON'T SEE HOW THIS HELPS ANYTHING IN PARTICULAR ABOUT THIS PAPER. BASICALLY, THIS AMPLITUDE IS SO SUPPRESSED, YOU SHOULD FORGET ABOUT IT. THERE'S NO POINT IN GIVING MORE DETAILS ABOUT SOMETHING SO INACCESSIBLE AND UNKNOWN.

375-376: "of leading tiwst" -> "leadong twist"

DISAGREE

-------
377 -> fine-structure constant
377 structure
377: ... fine structure
constant of the strong force.
377: structue-> structure

NOT FOR GLUONS!
-------

-------
377 fine structue
-> strong coupling constant (solves the typo also)

377: "fine structure constan"... shouldn't it be
alpha-strong?

377
replace ?fine structure? by ?strong coupling?


YES. OOPS! ;-)
--------

----------------
390 suggests that all
uncertainties are mentioned, but then in 398 'another' one is discussed,
and 407 starts another discussion. Please be more systematic.

391-398: the reasoning is involved, with some repetitions. I
would propose to remove "determined as in Ref.[6,7]" in 392. Move
"Contributions.... production" in 393-395 at 398 (the beginning of the
next paragraph). And start 395 as "The procedure to evaluate the
systematic uncertainty is described in detail in ...".

391-406: Whole paragrapf should be rewritten: "The
extracted ... from a combination of various contributions. One of these
is the background from processes that result in the production of
neutral mesons, determinated as in Refs. [6,7]. Another contribution
comes frm the relative shift of the missing mass distributions observed
between electron and positron data [16,17]. The missing-mass
distribution is also adjusted ... data taking periods respectively. This
uncertainty affects the beam-helicity amplitudes ... scale uncertainty."

393: "Contributions to the ...." -> I do
not like the way this sentence is written. Try to reformulate it.

L393:
in the data >> xxxxxx

393 uncertainties on the amplitudes --->
uncertainties of the amplitudes

394 the procedure is described ---> the
procedure to estimate them is described

398:
replace "There are shifts ..." with "The position of the missing mass
distribution varies from electron to positron data [16,17]" In addition
there is no explanation given for the shift of the missing mass and its
size.

PHRASING IMPROVED
----------------


----------
400: what is
adjusted (anyway a "cooking" term I don't like) the missing-mass
distribution or the missing-mass window ?

L400: is also adjusted>> Seems to be rather an
unfortunate expression as may suggest some "playing with the data".
sugg: also corrected

SEE NEW VERSION
-----------

401 As
before [6,7], one quarter...

DISAGREE

L401 "One quarter of the difference.."
What means this one quarter? Usual estimation for the systematics is
half of the max. difference, where this "quarter" is coming from? 

STANDARD DVCS ANALYSIS TECHNIQUE.

- Looking on Figs. 3 and 4 the reader can note that you have in some
places (e.g. last two points in t dependence for A_c^{cos(\phi)} on Fig.
3) quite big difference between the old and new data. Following the
conservative way this should be somehow qualified as a year dependence,
and the corresponding estimation for possible systematics should be
done? Later in Lines 513-516 you are stating that the ststistical test
on incompatibility was performed and no significant difference was
recognized, can you provide me with the numbers to quantiify words like
"significant" in sense of incompatibility? Best regards, Norik

YES, SEE SUPPORTING LITERATURE. (IF THERE WERE NO LARGE DIFFERENCES IN DATA SETS THIS SIZE, WE WOULD BE SUSPICIOUS :-)

402 see my comment about beam polarization
uncertainties

L405: which is present in the beam helicity
amplitudes >> xxxxx

DISAGREE

407 "including the
acceptance of the spectrometer" -- is this an uncertainty in the
acceptance of the spectrometer, which should cancel out in any asymmetry
measurement, or effects of the non-zero angular acceptance resulting in
smearing of kinematic quantitities?

THIS IS THE SECOND. 

408 Which radiative processes are meant? BH
is treated explicitly already. And a ref. to what is included (and how)
is needed.

RADIATIVE PROCESS THAT EFFECT THE DETECTION OF EVENTS, E.G. CALO SHOWERS THAT SPILL. NOT TO DO WITH 'NEW PHYSICS' AS SUCH.

410: ... that included these effects. An event ...

DISAGREE

412: I would
remove "because it describes the data well ..." -> This is not really a
good argument since it is a model.

DISAGREE - WE DON'T TRY TO EXTRACT ANY PHYSICAL MEANING FROM IT. IT MAY AS WELL BE AN ARBITRARY GENERATION BECAUSE IT'S ONLY USED TO EXTRACT THE MAGNITUDE OF DETECTOR EFFECTS ON THE DATA.

412: skip "because it describes the data well and is consistent with
Ref. [7]."

DISAGREE

414: ... procedure to extract
amplitudes as was for experimental data.

DISAGREE

416: "same" of what ? i.e.
"same GPD model in input to the MC generator"

THINK THIS IS CLEAR ENOUGH ALREADY - YOU WORKED IT OUT AND NO-ONE ELSE HAD A PROBLEM. CHANGED ANYWAY

417: "kinematic bin from the uncertainty contributions
of...uncertainties added in quadrature." -> "kinematic bin by adding in
quadrature the contributions of ... uncertainties. These contributions
and the resulting total uncertainty are reported in Table 2 for the
amplitudes extracted in a single bin (overall HERMES kinematic domain)."
and skip line 421.

AGREED

418 comma after "detector effects"

DISAGREE

L419: detector effects >> too vague sugg: detector
efficiency

DISAGREE. IS SEVERAL DETECTOR EFFECTS, NOT JUST EFFICIENCY


420-422: to my
understanding the new productions account for the best knowledge of
detector misalignment, but do not account for beam slopes. The
sensitivity of any analysis on the latter (systematic error) should be
still studied with dedicated MC productions. Was it considered ?

NOT CONSIDERED. PREVIOUS ANALYSES THAT CONSIDERED BEAM SLOPES SHOWED THAT THEY MADE NEGLIGIBLE CONTRIBUTIONS TO UNCERTAINTIES (SEE ZHENYU'S NOTE WITH ELKE FOR EXAMPLE) AND WE HAVE NOT THE TIME TO REMAKE MC PRODUCTIONS AND COMPLETE FURTHER STUDIES IN THIS WAY. 


420 an attentive referee would probably ask why there is no misalignment uncertainty for the new data? This question becomes even more relevant when combining
the two data sets.

DISAGREE

430 Say something
about the possible uncertainty in those fractions, please.

ASSOC. FRACTIONS ARE CALCULATED FROM THE BRASSE PARAMETERISATION WHICH WAS SELECTED AFTER A STUDY OF THREE CANDIDATES THAT LL ARE FAIRLY SIMILAR (SEE DVCS WIKI). TRUTH IS NO-ONE KNOWS WHAT THAT ASSOC. FRACTION SHOULD BE, AND THERE'S NO EASY, OBVIOUS WAY TO ESTIAMTE THE UNCERTAINTY ON THE FRACTIONS.


-line 474....we think that Fig 2 and Fig.3 we can remove. In text(line 515) there is very strong clarification that we can merge two datasets and we do.
Probably Referee could ask this Figures to see that sentence(line 515)
is correct, but the comparison Figures we think we can remove from
Paper. -as a Future Analyser for AC(0cos(phi)) we like to understand the
table 4 and 6 estimation sys error for Overall point. For 2006-2007 we
have 0.008 and by adding 2005-2006 dataset we see that it became 0.005.
We anticipate that we can reduce statistical error, but not systematical
one, is this true??? Thanks Avetik

WE ARE NOT LIMITED IN THE NUMBER OF PAGES AND SINCE THIS DATA HAS NOT BEEN PUBLISHED BEFORE IT IS GOOD TO SHOW IT. THE TWO ACCEPTANCES AND SETS OF MISSING MASS SHIFTS IN THE DATA SETS CANCEL IN THE SYSTEMATIC ERRORS FORTUITOUSLY.

494: ... separately for ...

DISAGREE


498 actually, have we ever tried to
estimate the uncertainty on the assoc. fractions? (just curious)

YES SEE ANSWER ABOVE.

------------------
497:
"imprecision" is not correct here. precision has to do with stat power.
You should write either "inaccuracy" or even better "uncertainty".

498 I don't like the use of "imprecision" in
describing the scale uncertainty due to the uncertainty on the
polarization measurement, this also applies to the captions of the
tables at the end

498: replace "imprecision of" by
"uncertainty in" ... measurements.

498
imprecision of the -> uncertainty of the

IMPRECISION IS PERFECTLY SUITED HERE. DICTIONARY DEFINITION: 'NOT ACCURATE'. HOWEVER, WILL CHANGE IT SINCE SEVERAL COMPLAINTS.

506- this sentence sounds very
confusing. try to reformulate it.

WHAT IS CONFUSING? REFORMULATE IT HOW? NOT A VERY USEFUL COMMENT.

Line 514 it is written: 'This test revealed
no significant evidence for incompatibility between data sets.' I
believe that this is true, but I would address to two largest -t points
in Fig.3 A_C(cos \phi) and A_C(cos(0\phi)) explicitely at this point. As
the two quantities are related I assume that the significance of the
deviation in both asymmetries is equal to that for a deviation in only
one. Is this true ? I would also guess that the significance of the
deviation could be affected by the Associated Fraction. In any case I
think that you should add a few remarks to explain why the apparent
difference is not significant. 

SEE OTHER ANSWERS


515: I do not like the word "significant" in this context because it
leaves some doubt about the compatibility.

ONE CANNOT TEST FOR COMPATIBILITY, BUT ONLY FOR INCOMPATIBILITY. GIVEN THAT ONE NEVER GETS A 0% CHANCE THAT TWO DATA SETS ARE INCOMPATIBLE, IT IS DIFFICULT TO WRITE THIS SECTION PRECISELY WITHOUT GLOSSING OVER THE ACTUAL TRUTH. IF THERE ARE CAST-IRON SUGGESTIONS, WE'D APPRECIATE THEM.

515: ... for an
incompatibility ...

NO.

548 again,
this brings up the question whether we can ensure stability of the
experimental setup (or better its influence on the extracted asymmetry
amplitudes, in particular A_C, over 12 years on the per mille level (I
recall other analyses that had to throw out data sets as they increased
too much the year dependence)

IF WE CAN OVER 10 YEARS, WHY NOT 12?

548: I do not like "experimental operation", sounds
weired

551: "analyzable events" -> chose other wording

WHICH OTHER WORDING?

-----------
552-554: what does
"weighted towards the 2006-2007 results" mean?

553 "are thus weighted towards the
2006-07 result" led to confusion (sounds like that actively some weights
were introduced?) Could this be reformulated using e.g. "the larger
impact of the 2006-07 data set"?


554:
skip to repeat "weighting towards the 2006-2007 result". Anyway I do not
understand what we mean by "weigthed towards": the expression suggests
the two results are different. Actually it is true for the systematics,
but this sentence does not adress the point.


IF YOU TAKE ONE DATA SET THAT HAS X EVENTS AND ANOTHER THAT HAS 3X AND AVERAGE, THE RESULT IS WEIGHTED TOWARD THE GREATER DATA SET.

CHANGED TO 'RESEMBLE'

----------

555: beam
helicity -> beam-helicity

AGREED

559: "value" ->
"magnitude"

AGREED

559-589: skip sentence "of any of the amplitudes... data
set."

NO.

----------
584: calculations *from* Ref[22] Best regards, Marco.

584 calculations 'from' Ref.22

AGREED.
----------


589: ... bin over
the entire ...

DISGAREE


589 "has" ->"shows" or "reveals" (it certainly _has_ a strong dependence on t if it has to vanish for t-> 0

AGREED.

----------
590: can you reformulate this sentence along the line
that -t has to go to zero for -t approaching zero?

590 and Fig. 4 Not only diminish, but go to
zero. For that reason it would be interesting to see the behaviour of
the models at very low -t.

591 it may be correct that the amplitude has to
vanish, but I can't see it from the reason you give: both the numerator
and the denominator of the asymmetry have BH propagators that cause the
k factors according to line

READER IS POINTED TO DEFINITION OF k IN BMK, WHICH HAS DEPENDENCE ON t.
---------


591: skip "of the amplitude" to avoid repetitions.

DISAGREE

---------
592: "can constrain the GPD H"

593: ... constraining
the GPD H. ....

DISAGREE
---------

594: "term" is unclear.

AGREE

----------
594 are -> is

594 amplitude is shown

AGREE
-----------

594: ... squared DVCS term. This amplitude is shown in
fig. 4. Both the A_LU,DVCS and the A_LU,I amplitude are compatible with
zero over the full range -t, x_B and Q^2. ...

AGREED

----------------
L594: amplitude >>
amplitudes

595: amplitude *is* shown. Anyway I would skip the sentence in
favor of a simple ", see Fig.4" at the end of the previous sentence.

595 amplitude shows

595: amplitude
'are' -> amplitude 'is'

L596: show >> shows


CHANGED AS ABOVE
----------------

----------------
597-600 this is out of place and not particularly
informative. I would move it to the systematics section and possibly
expand a little. You might cite previous publication as to how the
detector MC comes into play. If I were to read the reference would it be
obvious how to extend to using two data sets with different MCs?

598 Very vague statement.

AGREED
---------------

L599: the equipment >> the experimental
conditions

CHANGED

---------------
Line 602-603 It is not clear from eq.
3.6 that there is an inverse relationship between c_0 and c_I, since eq.
3.6 does not have a c_0 term, and it's not clear how this is related to
k. 

602: -> from eq. 3.6 you
can not see that c_0 is inverse prop. to c_1

602 You probably mean: opposite sign, and it
is not clear at all what k has to do with this. One expects to see a
relation between c0 and c1.

AGREED - CHANGED
---------------

----------------
L635: sign >> signs

635,636 These amplitudes diverge with ... ---> These
amplitudes have opposite sign and increase in magnitude with -t,
starting from close to zero. They show no discernible dependence ...

636x: What is meant by 'no discernible
dependence'? I see a different xB and Q2 behaviour, which is present
also in the models.

636: I see
a clear x (and Q2) dependence instead, at least for AC^cos(0phi).

CHANGED
-----------------

637: "value" -> "magnitude"

DISAGREE

L637: in value >> xxxxxxx

DISAGREE

L639: Both of
>> Both

DISAGREE

640:
"kinematic conditions" -> "kinematics"

DISAGREE

641 are these curves the functional dependences on either -t, x_B,
or Q^2, or---which I believe---plotted at the average kinematics of each
of the HERMES points? Then we should say so.

PLOTTED AT THE BIN CENTERS. UPDATED.

642 now "Hera" is in \sc
(unlike in 263)

YES.

642 maybe add references to the experimental data used

CAN BE FOUND IN REFERENCE.

----------------
642-643: "the colliders at HERA
and HERMES and Jefferson Lab" -> "the collider experiments at HERA and
from the HERMES and Jefferson Lab experiments."

L642: HERMES >> from HERMES (HERMES is not a collider)

642 colliders --> collider experiments

642
information from the colliders at HERA and HERMES and Jefferson Lab --->
information from H1, ZEUS, HERMES and the experiemnts at Jefferson Lab.

642:
delete "and" before HERMES

642 I
might put HERMES before HERA here, as written the sentence reads a
little weird.

CHANGED
----------------

643: I do not like the word
"minimalist"

POSSIBLY IT DOESN'T LIKE YOU. THIS IS HOW THE AUTHORS DESCRIBE IT.

645 remove hyphen after "physically"

AGREED

673: citations [24,25] comes before
citation [22] in 680. The figure captions restore the order, but I would
prefer the text follows it.

DISAGREE

673 some people would be happy to see it this way
but Jefferson Lab is still only a facility and not a laboratory (are you
trying to make the referee from JLab happy?:-) -> "Jefferson Lab"

WE DON'T SAY 'NATIONAL LABORATORY'. WHAT IS IT THAT YOU THINK 'LAB' IS SHORT FOR? LABRADOR? :-)

673 would "Hall A of .." not be better than "... in ..."

YES IT WOULD.

673: ... a model fit not including data ...in Hall A at ...

DISAGREE

673: "Jefferson
Laboratory" -> "Jefferson Lab" (as in 643 and 684)

WE PREFER TO CHANGE IT THE OTHER WAY ROUND.

L673:
without data >> disregarding the data

DISAGREE

674: this data -> 'these' data

CHANGED.

676: replace "calculation" by "results"

AGREED

-------------
676: "All of the
amplitudes" -> "All amplitudes"

L677: All of >> All

DISAGREE, BUT CHANGED 
--------------

678 Fig. 738 were -> was

DISAGREE

678: "made from" -> "based on"

AGREED

L678: shows >>
show
AGREED

---------
678 Figs. -> Fig.

678 add ?and 5? after ?4?

AGREED
---------

679 describe accurately -> accurately
describe

DISAGREE

682 -> "elastic-scattering data"

CHANGED

685 again, are x and Q2 dependences plotted or
model at average kinematics of each bin?

MODEL AT AVG KINS.

686: -> do you want to add that
actually the slope has the opposite sign? fig7. what is the source of
the huge syst. uncertainty in the last bin in the -t dependence?

NOT CONVINCED THAT THE DATA HAS AN OBJECTIVE SLOPE.

UNCERTAINTY COMES FROM MC - HIGH-T/LOW-XB CORRESPONDS TO REGION OF SPECTROMETER WITH POOR RESOLUTION.

687:
"using Compton..." -> "based on Compton"

DISAGREE.

687 (Guidal fits) - Ref [23] is 'Priv Comm' - is there the change of an
arXiv by the date of submission? It is very hard to guess what was done
exactly from the few lines in draft 90. - Did Guidal use only HERMES
data or also JLab for this specific work? - We do not like the Guidal
results being shown as points, especially not in the plot with the main
result of the paper. This gives too my the impression of measured data.
Please consider connecting the data points by a line, dropping the
symbols.

GUIDAL'S POINTS ARE ONLY VALID AS POINTS - THEY ARE EXTRACTED AT FIXED KINEMATICS AND CANNTO (SHOULD NOT) BE EXTRAPOLATED. GUIDAL USED BOTH JLAB AND HERMES DATA. THIS SECTION IS REMOVED AS HE PLANS TO PUBLISH THIS NEW WORK SEPARATELY.

------------------
688 -> form factors (not
capitalized)

Line 688 "Compton Form factors extracted from experimental data... "
What experimental quantitites in particular were used to obtain these
CFF's? [23] is only a private communication which gives no details. If
the CFF's are largely extracted from the same beam-helicity and
beam-charge asymmetries shown in this paper, then its' not so surprising
that the open crosses give good agreement with data. If the CFF's were
extracted from completely different observables, then it's much more
significant that there is good agreement with data.

715 -> form factors

716 either use the
abbreviation CFF throughout the paper or spell it out, but please don't
mix them at random and not in one sentence

717: somewhat a tautology, if the CFF are
extracted using a set of data compatible with (and merged into) the
present result.

717:
... by these calculations. ...

WILL BE REMOVED
-----------------

718 "that" -> ", which"

DISAGREE

721 dependence on any -> dependence of any

AGREED

722 , 723 The calligraphic A does not appear in the plots. Use
either "A" or write out beam-charge asymmetry" etc.

CALLIGRAPHIC A IS DEFINED IN 3.2 - 3.4 AS SET OF AMPLITUDES

722 either -> any

AGREED

723 I would be more brave and claim that only at smaller values of xB the
strong t dependences of the constant and the cos\phi term are visible,
but not for large x

WE STATE NO ADDITIONAL FEATURES - YOU COULD DEDUCE THIS FROM THE 1D PROJECTIONS ALSO.

Sec 6: Similar ciritisim to the abstract--the reader is
told hwo good the data is, but only one sentence saying that they have
to do with GPDs--can any stronger conclusion be drawn?

NOT SIMPLY, NO.

737
delete ?new?

DISAGREE

----------
L738:were >> was

738 'were'
extracted -> was extracted (set is singular)

739 were extracted -> was
extracted

AGREE
----------

739: add comma after "period"

DISAGREE

740 datasets, (one word, comma)

DISAGREE

740/741 A comparison of ...
data sets have shown -> A comparison of ... data sets has shown

AGREE

742 -?-> statistically most precise

DISAGREE

---------------
743-745: "that will be published by
the HERMES ..." -> "obtained by the HERMES collaboration. The extracted
asymmetry amplitudes show a strong signal in the first harmonic ...""


743: "that will be publiushed by the HERMES collaboration" -> "available
at the HERMES experiment"


743: "will be published by the HERMES
collaboration" is too strong. I would write "is available from HERMES".

WHY TOO STRONG? IT'S CORRECT.
-----------------

744 as this was
already known I would replace "show" by "confirms" (and singular not
plural!)

DISAGREE

-----------------
744: ... amplitudes shows ...

744/745
The result of .. amplitudes show -> The result of .. amplitudes shows

744 show -> shows

AGREE
-----------------

-------------
745 -?-> nonzero

745 non-zero

745 non zero -> non-zero

AGREE NON-ZERO
-------------

746 -> higher-order

AGREE

746: "Each of the other" -> "All the other"

DISAGREE

------------
747 is consistent (each is singular) ref [7] JHEP 11

L747: are >> is

AGREE

747 amplitudes are consistent ---> amplitudes is consistent

AGREE, BUT NO REF IN THE SUMMARY.
-------------

749 "No"? - see my comment to 723

SEE MY ANSWER

750 "t" -> "x_B"

CHANGED IN 751.

-------------
766 please add "the Basque Foundation for
Science (IKERBASQUE);" after "NSF);"

766 add ?the Basque Foundation for Science (IKERBASQUE);?

LATEST WEB VERSION WILL BE USED. IS IT CHANGED?
--------------

780, 820, 840, 875 ?-t?, ?x_B? and ?Q^2? should be replaced by ?<-t?>,
?<x_B>? and ?<Q^2>?

YES!

796- Try to
make smaller sentences in the caption. 

DISAGREE.

798 -> this is also true for all
the other captions of the tables.

DISAGREE - THE OTHERS ARE BEAM CHARGE OR HAVE DIFFERENT POLARISAITON!

914 replace ?0911? by ?11?
