This was the git repository that we used to write the culmination paper on unpolarised DVCS at HERMES.

The paper was published in 2012 - it's available on the arXiv here: http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.6287 and was published by JHEP.

According to Google Scholar, it has received 12 citations at the time of writing. Its older brother, which I also helped to write can be found here: http://arxiv.org/abs/0909.3587 and has 46 citations.
