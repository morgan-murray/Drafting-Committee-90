	set of detectors for particle identification (a lead-glass calorimeter,
	a pre-shower detector, a transition radiation detector, and a threshold
	Cherenkov detector). Two of the main features of the spectrometer
	are its good acceptance and identification of both positrons and
	hadrons, in particular pions. These characteristics, together with
	the purity of the targets, are allowing HERMES to make unique contributions
	to the understanding of how the spins of the quarks contribute to
	the spin of the nucleon.},

	been in use since 1996 with the polarized electron beam of HERA at
	DESY to study the spin structure of the nucleon. Polarized atoms
	from a Stern-Gerlach Atomic Beam Source are injected into a storage
	cell internal to the HERA electron ring. Atoms diffusing from the
	center of the storage cell into a side tube are analyzed to determine
	the atomic fraction and the atomic polarizations. The atoms have
	a nuclear polarization, the axis of which is defined by an external
	magnetic holding field. The holding field was longitudinal during
	1996-2000, and was changed to transverse in 2001. The design of the
	target is described, the method for analyzing the target polarization
	is outlined, and the performance of the target in the various running
	periods is presented.},
