  <p class="comment">COMMENTS: Dear DC90, thank you for the updated draft. I did not take too
  much attention to the text, as it sounds basically fine to me. However
  there are still several points for which I miss a clarification.
     <p class="reply complete general">
     Dear Marco,

     There are a couple of general points to bear in mind with our replies to your comments. The first is that the associated fraction in each bin is poorly known; we used three parameterisations that produced a 20-30% variance between them and picked Brasse as the middle one. So, a lot of your concerns about the associated fractions in each bin and with different geometries are difficult to answer from that point of view, because the genuine answer is that we don&apos;t really know enough to construct an accurate MC model. The second is about beam slopes. Elke and Zhenyu produced an internal report that detailed the affect that beam slopes may have on DVCS asymmetries. The conclusion from their work is more or less that the beam slopes have a very, very small effect. To see an effect in the TTSA amplitudes, one needs to have a beam slope in the MC about 10 times that expected in the experiment. So, although we have not done dedicated work there (neither have DC69, 80, 81, 91 or 92), we&apos;re not concerned by that.
     </p>
     </p>
     <p class="comment">
     I do not see a response to my general comments to the first circulation,
     which I report below. In our acceptance x and Q2 are highly correlated
     and this is not adressed in the text referring to the 1D projections.
     The 2D projection is superior since resolve part of the correlations.
     However, you should check how the associated fraction behaves in the 2D
     binning. I assume this is not a big deal, and can be done by anybody
     involved in DVCS analysis. 
        <p class="reply todo complete">
	I have a feeling that anyone reading our paper should realise that xB and Q2 are correlated at a fixed-target, fixed-angle experiment. In fact, we didn&apos;t feel it necessary to mention in DC69 at all. If you feel very strongly about it, then we can include a sentence, but we give the average kinematics of every bin and I think that any reader should see that there&apos;s an obvious relationship. If you do feel strongly about it, please contact the DC directly.

	The associated fraction in each bin has the caveat written above. However, we have looked at that and it is included in the plots.
	</p>
     </p>
     <p class="comment">
       By comparing 2006-2007 with published result
       we do a statistics test. Fine and probably acceptable (although not so
       powerful given the small bin number). However I see a possible
       systematic trend for the non-zero AC^cos amplitudes in Fig.3. Did you
       check if in the high stitictics MC there is a systematic effect due to
       the different vertex distribution ? 
        <p class="reply incomplete todo">
	</p>

     </p>
     <p class="comment">
       Is the associated fraction insensitive to the different geometry ? Also the beam slope could play a
       role, see analysis issues below. 
        <p class="reply complete">
	  Pretty much, the associated fraction is insensitive to the different geometry. Compare figure 3 in the current paper and figure 2 of DC69, for example.
	</p>
     </p>

  <p class="comment">
After the submission of the draft, the
yield dependence in 2007 was explained by an unaccounted detector
effect. Did you extend the multi-clusters study on the full dataset and
check the consequences in the values (minor changes I hope) and in the
systematics (reduction) ? 
<p class="reply complete check">
We did extend the multicluster analysis to the entire dataset and found that we had odd results in the 2005 electron data set. We don't have the manpower to investigate that, so it was decided to do multicluster for 2006-07 and leave the 1996-2005 dataset as it was published.
</p>
</p>

<p class="comment">
Are we going to mention in the paper the
availability of the rebinned (in 4 bins) version of the results ?
<p class="reply complete todo">
I have no strong feeling about this one way or the other. To see if it illicits any strong response, I included a sentence in the conclusion; we can always take it out if someone has a problem with it
</p>
</p>

<p class="comment">
Regarding some analysis issues rised in the past, I am still missing
some informations: *) what is the conclusion of the H0 test (slide 27 of
June release-update) ? I see the numbers moving in opposite directions
for 2006 + and - helicity: is this affecting the asymmetry?

<p class="reply complete">
Jonathan checked this at the time. He tells me that the difference in the asymmetry is so small that one does not see it to three significant figures, i.e. the accuracy to which we publish.
</p>

</p>
<p class="comment">
*) is the
average kinematics of 2006/2007 the same of previous long-target-cell
runs
<p class="reply complete">
Obviously they&apos;re not identical, but they are within 1% of each other.
</p>
</p>

<p class="comment">
*) it is odd you use a model for systematic evaluation which
&quot;describes data well&quot; but does not enter the final plots, where the
comparison is made with different models. Looking to the plots in the
June release-update I would say, once more, the model we use for
systematics is far to be the best description of our data. It hardly
describes the AC^cosphi amplitude and overestimates the ALU,I^sinphi. It
is a pity for the result claimed to have the &quot;best HERMES statistical
accuracy&quot;. I understand there is a manpower problem here. Thus do we
take MC model minus reconstruced-asymmetry as absolute value or do we
propagate the relative systematic effect to data ? The motivation given
in 413 sounds odd. One expect improvements with time, so there is no
point to justify the choice to resemble what was done 2 years ago for a
less precise measurement. Actually from 558-559 it is not clear if you
kept the published 1996-2005 systematics or you re-evaluated it in the
total sample. From slide 61 in the June release-update I understand the
systematic for the total sample was re-evaluated from scratch,
automatically accounting for correlations between 96-05 and 06-07
systematics (something not clarified in the text). Did you use the old
MC production for 96-05, meaning the 96-05 all-in-one would stay
untouched ? By the way you did not mention the background subtraction in
558-588. 
<p class="reply jonathan incomplete todo">
The 1996-2005 data sample systematics were kept as was published. The combined data sample's systematics are averages of the 4-in-1, Missing Mass and Background systematic uncertainties.
</p>
</p>
<p class="comment">
to my understanding the new productions account for the best
knowledge of detector misalignment, but do not account for beam slopes.
The sensitivity of any analysis on the latter (systematic error) should
be still studied with dedicated MC productions. Was it considered ? 
<p class="reply complete">
It was considered, albeit briefly. We don&apos;t have the manpower to make new and analyse new MC productions, but there&apos;s an indication from Elke and Zhenyu&apos;s report that this is not a problem.
</p>
</p>
<p class="comment">
Some additional point: 304-305: the sentence is not correct, since you
extract the asymmetry moments instead of the cross-section moments. In
principle you have (more) physically motivated modulations which stem
from the ones in the denominator. 
<p class="reply complete todo">
We have rephrased this as &quot;are motivated by the physics processes under investigation&quot;
</p>
</p>

<p class="comment">
448: here you may want to refer to
upcoming publications adressing the associated fraction issue. 
<p class="reply complete">
This would be awkward as we don&apos;t have any physical document to reference, even conference proceedings and we&quot;d rather not promise future work. If you feel very strongly about this, please contact the committee. Otherwise, we won&apos;t make a reference.
</p>
</p>

<p class="comment">
Fig.2 and 3: these are used to only compare 96-05 and 06-07 results. I would be in
favor to add the 06-07 systematics here, in order the Figures can be
used to show the new complete 06/07 result, otherwise presented only
into tables, together with the comparison. 
<p class="reply committee">
These figures do have both the statistical and the total uncertainties in them. That&apos;s not such an unusual way to present data and we&apos;re concerned that putting the extra systematics onto the plot could be confusing.
</p>
</p>

<p class="comment">
629-631: which is the order
of magnitude of the expected suppression in our kinematical regime. Do
the DATA agree with this expectation ? I think this should be part of
the discussion.
<p class="reply todo incomplete committee">
The expected surpression is maybe 1 order of magnitude. You can see from the predictions from KM and GGL that the data more or less agrees with this purely kinematic relationship. We can include an extra line in the text.
</p>
</p>

<p class="comment">
632-634: to my eye there is a trend. Have you made a
statistical test to support your statement, i.e. did you try to fit a
slope for xB and Q2 dependence and look to its significance ? 
<p class="reply todo incomplete">
In any trend, one should also consider the systematics band. When you build that into your comparison, the seeming-dependence becomes much less obvious.
</p>
</p>

<p class="comment">
676-677:
the description of the AC^cos(0phi) terms is not extraordinary in xB and
Q2. It is anyway difficult to judge given the compressed plot. Can you
expand vertically the first row in Fig.5, using a bit of space from the
second row ? 
<p class="reply complete committee">
The axes are chosen carefully to as to be absolutely the same for every row in the plot. If we blew up the axis for the first row, we&apos;d ruin that effect and make it more difficult to compare the amplitudes.
</p>
</p>

<p class="comment">
743-744: statistically most precise presented by HERMES
(summary) is different from statistically most precise in the HERMES
kinematic regime (abstract). Which one of the two ? 
<p class="reply todo complete">
In effect, they&apos;re the same thing. We have changed the abstract to match the summary precisely.
</p>
</p>

<p class="comment">
Figure 7: the too
enlarged scale somewhat downgrade the significance of our result, since
everything seems close to zero. I would suggest to zoom the scale and
highlight the points of small statistical error (making the last
visible!). The ones with large error are less interesting anyway and can
partly lay outside of the plot.

++++++++++++++++ Comments to Draft 90, 2nd circulation
++++++++++++++++++++ "Beam-helicity and beam-charge asymmetries in the
BH and DVCS processes on an unpolarized proton target"
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ version 2.0
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 
I am happy to see this draft moving
towards publication! I think most of the work has been done, though I
still feel a bit uneasy with a few aspects, though. In particular, still
little is said how the data sets were combined (especially w.r.t. the
systematics), and the beam-charge asymmetry partially has still a very
small uncertainty despite substantial false A_C seen in SIDIS. But if I
am the only one worrying about this ... 

Before sending out my comments I
went through the answers to my previous comments. Unfortunately, for
many points only a "disagree" was given, which does not help clarifying
the points. If I still need such clarification I will bring it up again
here. frequent notations in these comments: -> ... change to -?-> ...
maybe change to rm ... remove rm(?)... maybe remove for commenting the
\usepackage{lineno} option would be more helpful as often the lines are
in between numbers given to the left.

084 rm "statistically" -- I hope it is THE most
precise set of measurement, including systematics (otherwise why mention
in the abstract). 
<p class="reply complete committee">
No, it&apos;s not really the most precise. The recoil detector result can claim to be the most precise because it has no associated fraction in the data set. DC90 is the most precise only when considering the associated fraction to be a part of the signal. It does have the most statistical precision, though, which is why we&apos;ve worded this sentence in this way.

<p class="comment">
152ff I still don&apos;t like
the connection of &quot;ALTHOUGH GPDs ... difficult to access experimentally,
the HERMES ...&quot;. What has our measurement to do with the fact that &quot;GPDs
are difficult to access&quot;, and why this needs to be connected by an
ALTHOUGH? At least I would then add other experiments either. The
argument that this is not meant as a review I don&apos;t like: a) there are
not that many other results (you list 8 HERMES publications!), and b) it
is common practice to acknowledge the work of others who have done the
same kind of work as oneself. How would you feel if COMPASS publishes,
e.g., its special beam-charge asymmetry but ignores your very
measurement of DC90? 
</p>
<p class="reply complete todo">
Well, some people may be put off doing DVCS measurements (I have heard complaints that the exclusive physics business is too complicated to be useful from other physicists before). Although the connection to GPDs and then to GTMDs and thus to Wigner Distributions and hence actual quarks is complicated, we&apos;ve made the measurement anyway. We are somewhat used to other people not referencing our DVCS results, actually. However, maybe we can take the high road and cite them anyway.

Yes, you&apos;re correct. Our experience with JHEP has been that they pick their own set of abbreviations and apply them before publication anyway. We had attempted to use Klaus&apos; advice from the previous circulation to match the final JHEP style this time round. We&apos;ll take a look at it anyhow.
</p>
<p class="comment">
Table 1 I protest against oversimplification: From your description it
is not at all clear and even more counterintuitive why, e.g., the first
entry is twist-2 and the second twist-3. It is, according to the table,
the same CFF and the twist of the involved GPD determines the the twist
of the CFF and such (besides kinematic suppression) its suppression
(according to 318ff) Careful reading of BKM reveals that the table is
misleading, if not wrong: these are different CFFs appearing in row 1&amp;2
(and likewise rows 4-6). What is missing is that the "C-functions" have
as an argument a set of GPDs (the "C-functions" are a kind of meta
function). And the CFFs in row one and two involve different sets of
GPDs (cf. [BKM] table 1). Either expand the discussion (even more a
reason to put this in the theory section and not the
experimental-extraction section) or remove, but don&apos;t let the same CFF
be once twist-2 and another time twist-3. 
</p>
<p class="reply complete todo">
Yes and no. Using the Wandura-Wilczek approximation, one can write twist-3 quantities in terms of twist-2 quantities with some extra correction factor. That&quot;s what we refer to here, so in a sense, the same CFF is accessed on both twist-2 and twist-3 levels. However, you&quot;re correct that this is not explicitly stated, so we&quot;ve rewritten it for clarity.

<p class="comment">
Table 2 I must admit I still
feel rather uncomfortable with quoting an experimental uncertainty of
down to 0.002 on our beam-charge asymmetry having seen large false
asymmetries (e.g., in SIDIS). As I have no means of quantifying these
effects in DVCS I don&apos;t know yet what to do. And I am not too happy
about the answers given to this concern in the first round of comments.
Maybe I had been less concerned for the preRD data set - for whatever
reason; but when one claims the most precise measurement also the
validity of the systematics studies needs to be checked. Maybe the
statistical uncertainty of the previous measurement was by far not as
good and thus the requirement on the systematics not so stringent. When
one finally enters high statistical precision, one needs to make sure
that the systematics live up to such standards and this is the
difference between 1996-2005 and 1996-2007!

Figs 2-7 are still not consistent

too small in 4&amp;5 - font size for theory labels too small in Fig. 5 -
distances of y-axis labels are different in basically each figure - too
many axis-value labels on assoc. fractions, especially in Fig. 5 they
start to overlap - y-axis numbers are not aligned - almost all font
sizes in Figs. 6 and 7 are different in the two figures

Agreed. This is a consequence of having two different plot authors; after Jonathan left to go work for the IAEA, Jennifer made a couple of the plots. We will make them consistent for the next time around.
</p>
</p>

<p class="comment">
595 is that really the reason for the vanishing at low t? And, again (I mentioned
this already in previous comments), I don&apos;t agree with the argument (and
the answer to the comments). Eq. 3.5 deals with the numerator of the
asymmetry only. Even if the numerator goes to zero the asymmetry does
not have to do so, e.g., when the denominator has the same suppression
factor K involved. Indeed, looking carefully at [BKM] one finds that
most terms in the denominator have this factor K and even K^2, except
the suppressed DVCS contribution (and some BH terms). This info is not
given in the draft. Actually, the non-vanishing of the asymmetry
amplitude does tell you something about the sizes of these terms as you
will only see the vanishing with t->0 when the terms with K factor in
the denominator become smaller than the terms without it. Well, I would
be happy with &quot;... approaches zero due to the different powers in K that
appear in the terms in the numerator and denominator of this amplitude
and K vanishing in the limit t>0.&quot; (or something like that, just a bit
more polished) The current text refers to Eq. 3.5 and that is just not
an sufficient answer.

Broadly agreed. We will send you a new version before the final submission.

My point is that &apos;Lab&apos; is not a word in English; it&apos;s an abbreviation for Laboratory or Labrador. It is a word in middle English, it meant to tell tales, but it is rarely used in that context today.
I understand that JLab don&apos;t have the word Laboratory on their webpage, but Laboratory is implied by Lab. and the full word is more formal than the abbreviation.
In fact, <a href="http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/104673?rskey=lFdoYB&result=2&isAdvanced=false#eid">the OED marks &apos;lab&apos; explicitly as colloquial</a>, which is something that I wanted to avoid.

Tables: should I worry about the significant improvement of the stat. uncertainty on the
beam-spin asymmetry amplitudes compared to version 1.0 (or better be

The wrong latex files were included in the version for first circulation. Jonathan and I have independently gone over the tables for the current (3rd circ.) version and they are now correct.

When writing DC80, I was explicitly told by Klaus *not* to include titles and preprints in the bibliography. So, for DC90, I followed the style set in DC69. I&apos;ll change it back.

<p class="comment">
At least the systematic
uncertainties do not grow anymore by factor two when you combine the
results. Strangely enough from your answer I understand you disagree
with me, still, you changed the systematics so that they don&apos;t look
wrong anymore, i.e., they do not grow anymore by factor of two but
mostly stay the same after the combination, which is what I expected.
Can you please clarify the issue, i.e, what did you do so that the
systematics now behave as I expected, while they don&apos;t show the dramatic
growth anymore you think they need to show? (Quoting from the first
circulation: &quot;Frank: Basically, the results get worse when you combine
the 1996-2005 and the 2006/07 data, when compared to the 2006/07 data
alone. This is due to a dramatic increase in the systematic uncertainty,
see, e.g., ALUI-sinphi (0.026 -> 0.047) or AC-cosphi (0.003 -> 0.014) in
tables 3-6. This cannot happen as the results are in agreement (i.e.,
there is no error inflation in order to release tension between
results.) Basically, by adding information your result cannot get worse
if the combination is done the right/best way. AUTHORS: SYSTEMATIC
UNCERTAINTY FOR NEW RESULTS WAS DONE USING A DIFFERENT GENERATOR AND A
DIFFERENT GEOMETRY IN THE MC. IT&apos;S PERFECTLY REASONABLE FOR THE
SYSTEMATIC ERROR TO GET WORSE WHEN ADDING TWO DIFFERENT RESULTS, IN FACT
IT IS EXPECTED. IT WOULD BE UNREASONABLE IF THE STATISTICAL ERROR WERE
TO WORSEN, BUT THAT DID NOT HAPPEN.)&quot;
<p class="reply complete check">
The systematics were previously done by generating MC files for 96-05 geometry with the dual generator and MC files for 06-07 with the VGG generator, combining them in proportion and extracting the 4-in-1 uncertainty, along with an averging of the uncertainty due to the missing-mass spread and the background uncertainties. In this instance, it is expected that the systematic uncertainty grows by some factor. I didn&apos;t think that a factor of 2 was unreasonable, but I had no prior expectations.

For the second circulation, the procedure for calculating uncertainties is different. We don't have the ability to generate the dual model asymmetries with the 06-07 geometry, so a compromise was needed. After taking into account comments from the first circulation, at the second release meeting in June we presented systematics calculated at the average kinematics of each bin using the (unfixed) dual generator with the 96-05 geometry and averaging them; this is what you see in the second circulation. We then used the multi-cluster method for the 06-07 dataset and averaged the missing-mass and background uncertainties between the two datasets. This was the preferred method. The geometry change makes very little difference to the actual asymmetries, and the collaboration preferred to use the same generator over using the more accurate 06-07 geometry.

If you need more dialogue on this issue, please contact the DC directly.

<p class="comment">
I asked already last time but still
from your answer have not 100% understood if you reanalyzed the
1996-2005 data or if you have taken the published 1996-2005 data and
combined the published values with the new 2006-2007 result? You should
take the published data as is and combine with the new result, except
you found a bug in the old analysis. The paper is not explicit in that
respect, e.g, line 504: "extracted separately from previously published
1996-2005". What does that mean, you extracted from something already
published? Please rephrase.... 
<p class="reply complete todo check">
Jonathan re-analysed 1996-2005 and obtained precisely the same result as Dietmar and Hongxue. Then, in each kinematic bin, he extracts phi values for events in 06-07. He then fits the asymmetries in each bin to the collective phi values. In truth, it makes little difference to do things this way than it does to average them, but it&apos;s slightly easier to include the correctpolarisations and luminosities. The systematics are calculated by averaging the systematics calculated in DC69 with the systematics calculated for the 06-07 dataset. We&apos;ve rephrased the relevant piece of the paper.

Next you talk about &quot;can therefore be

correct. Please change to something like &quot;the results are combined&quot; as
there hopefully was no new extraction on the old and published data.
Same ambiguities are in the captions of figure 2 and 3. Simply use
&quot;published&quot; when talking about the old data, and extracted only when
talking about the 2006/2007 data. 
<p class="reply complete todo check">
If youread the reply above, you can see that the results are extracted from the complete dataset and so this is correct. Following the same method but excluding the 06-07 dataset results in precisely the same values as DC69, so we&apos;re happy that what's done is accurate.

<p class="comment">
Also, last time I said: &quot;Unfortunately
it is not stated at all how the combination is done&quot;, which meant,
please state how you combine the published and the new data set. State
that in the paper please, I should have been more specific about that.
The important part here is to say which systematic uncertainties are
fully correleated, partially correlated, and uncorrelated. This
paragraph has to be there. You only touch the issue in line 516, please

Three more things: Abstract &quot;represent the most

precision and terribly large systematic uncertainties. Either one has
the &quot;overall best precision&quot; or one should not mention it. Nobody cares
if only the stat. unc is small, but the sys unc is potentially
humongous. Please also remove this statement in the summary. 
<p class="reply complete">
I wrote a similar reply to Marco above. This is not the most precise data set because it includes an (unknown) amount of delta-production data. It is statistically more precise than the recoil dataset, but because we never assigned a systematic error to the fraction of associated production we cannot quantify the true systematic error on the measurement (in truth we never did in any of our DVCS measurements, but people still cared). It may be possible to say more about this if we ever manage to extract an associated asymmetry, but that looks like being so far from completion that we&apos;d rather not address it in this paper.

<p class="reply complete">
The precision in the BHA is different to the precision in the BCA due to the fraction of the beam polarisation; it inflates the BHA but not the BCA. The statement &quot;Results from the two datasets...&quot; refers generally to results from the two datasets; it doesn&apos; explicitly address the BHA or the BCA.

169-170: The way this is phrased makes it a general statement about the mechanism of

at low values of W or Q2 cannot be described by the DVCS diagram shown,
and even at Hermes kinematic conditions it is a question if not more
diagrams contribute. Therefore, at least include some words such as: At
Hermes kinematical conditions the exclusive ......can be (or: is assumed
to be) described by two .... or state explicitly that even at Hermes
kinematics there may be other diagrams contributing. 
<p class="reply complete committee">
We, very carefully, do not say that exlcusive leptoproduction arises solely from those diagrams. As it is written, the paper only states that those diagrams create exclusive leptoproduction. It does not say that only those diagrams create exclusive leptoproduction, or that any arbitrary exclusive leptoproduction must have a contribution from those diagrams, so I&apos;m not sure your complaint is valid. Please contact the DC directly if you have strong feelings on the matter.

629-632: These
sentences are not accurately phrased and too brief. Why not be a little
more specific and therefore much more clear? Given eq. 3.6? there is
some relation (therefore not &apos;expected&apos;, but most probably
&apos;approximate&apos;) between A_C^0phi and A_C^1phi, which depends on the
kinematic factor given in table 1. That factor is called a suppression
factor, but is it really a suppression at Hermes kinematics? And how
does it depend on x_B and Q2? If I look at the data then I see the
following: t dependence: ratio of A_C^0phi to A_C^1phi is about -0.6.
That is not really a suppression. And is that roughly consistent with
the numerical value of the factor given in table 1? x_B and Q2
dependence: here the ratio seems to go from well below -1.0 at small
values of x_B or Q2 to around zero at large values of x_B or Q2. Is that
(at least qualitatively) consistent with the given factor in table 1? If
both answers are yes, mention it. If the answer is no, say something
more about the relation between A_C^0phi and A_C^1phi, such as the
possible contribution of other terms, with the conclusion that at our
kinematics the relation is not valid/useful. In either case do not speak
about a suppression factor; it is just a kinematic factor (which at
special kinematics, e.g., large Q2, gives suppression).

Dear Beni, A lot of your comments are subjective and style based. Very few of them are obviously wrong, however they don't really correct the text; they just change to a slightly different way of doing things. Since I am obviously biased towards my own way of doing things, where such a comment has come up, I have just written &quot; disagree&quot;. If there&quot;s any clarification wanted, please contact me directly.
