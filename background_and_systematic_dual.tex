\section{Background Corrections and Systematic Uncertainties for the
  2006-2007 Data}
The extracted asymmetry amplitudes are subject to systematic uncertainties \red{contributions} that result from a combination of background processes, shifts in the missing-mass distributions\red{,} and various detector and binning effects determined in the same manner as \red{used} in refs.~\cite{Air08,Air09} \red{in orer to maintain consistency with the results published in ref.~\cite{Air09} and therefore facilitate the combination of the two data sets}.

The contribution to the uncertainties on the amplitude measurements
arising from background in the data from neutral meson
production is predominantly due to the failure to identify one of
  the two photons from the decay of \red{these} neutral mesons. The procedure for estimating the corresponding
uncertainty on the measured amplitude values is described in detail in
refs.~\cite{Air08,Air09}. Each measurement in the $-t$, $x_{\textrm{B}}$ and
  $Q^{2}$ projections has this uncertainty estimated at the
  centre of the relevant kinematic bin and included as part of the
  total systematic uncertainty.

A contribution to the systematic uncertainties of the
  measured amplitudes arises from shifts in  the
missing-mass distributions. Such shifts appear in a comparison of electron and positron data~\cite{Zei09,Bur10}. One
quarter of the difference between the asymmetries extracted using the standard
and shifted missing-mass windows is taken as the corresponding systematic
uncertainty. 

The predominant contribution to the systematic uncertainty arises from detector
effects. These include the acceptance of the spectrometer, smearing
effects due to detector resolution (e.g. the \red{minimum} opening angle between the scattered lepton and produced photon trajectories that can be resolved in the calorimeter), external radiation in detector material, \red{potential misalignment} and the finite bin width of the $-t$, $x_{\textrm{B}}$ and $Q^{2}$ projections. In order to quantify these effects, events were generated using a Monte Carlo simulation of the spectrometer that included them. An event generator based on the GPD model described in ref.~\cite{Guz06} was used for the simulation because it\red{s output} describes the data well and was employed in ref.~\cite{Air09}. Asymmetry amplitudes were extracted from these simulated events using the same analysis procedure used to
extract amplitudes from experimental data. In each kinematic bin, the
systematic uncertainty was determined as the difference between the asymmetry amplitude reconstructed from the simulated data and that
calculated from the GPD model at the average $-t$, $x_{\textrm{B}}$ and
$Q^{2}$ value for that bin.

The total systematic uncertainty for the 2006-2007 data sample was
determined for each kinematic bin by adding in quadrature the
  uncertainties arising from the background correction, the
  missing-mass shifts, and the detector effects.  The 1996-2005 sample also has a systematic uncertainty from misalignment of the spectrometer~\cite{Air09}, which has been eliminated for the 2006-2007 data sample due to improved
  surveying measurements. \red{However}, because the systematic uncertainty calculation for the 2006-07 data \red{uses the same Monte Carlo generator and reconstruction technique as was used} for the 1996-2005 data, the systematic uncertainty for 2006-07 is overestimated\red{; t}his overestimate is very slight, because the systematic uncertainty contribution from potential misalignment \red{affecting the 1996-2005 data set} is very small.

The contribution from each uncertainty to each amplitude extracted from the 2006-2007 data (in a single, overall kinematic bin) is summarised in Table~\ref{table_systematic_contributions_0607}.

The beam polarisation measurements have total uncertainties of 2.8\% for the 1996-2005 data-taking period and 3.4\% for the 2006-2007 data taking period. These uncertainties are present in the beam-helicity amplitudes and are as independent scale uncertainties without inclusion in the other presented uncertainties.
