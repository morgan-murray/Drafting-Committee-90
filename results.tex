\section{Results}
Results for the beam-helicity and beam-charge asymmetry amplitudes extracted separately from previously published 1996-2005 and the new 2006-2007 hydrogen data sets, are presented in Figs. \ref{release_bsa_0607} and \ref{release_bca_0607}. Each of the asymmetry amplitudes is shown extracted in one bin over all kinematic variables (``overall'') and also projected against $-t$, $x_{\textrm{B}}$ and $Q^{2}$. All of the extracted asymmetry amplitudes are subject to a fractional contribution to the event yield from associated production (``Assoc. fraction''), which is shown in the bottom row of each figure. The beam-helicity asymmetry amplitudes are subject to an additional scale uncertainty from the measurement of the beam polarisation, which is stated in the captions of the figures.

An additional 2.8\,\% and 3.4\,\% scale uncertainty for the 1996-2005 and
2006-2007 data respectively is present in the amplitudes due to the imprecision of
the beam polarisation measurement. The simulated fractional contribution from associated production to the yield in each kinematic bin is shown in the bottom row.}

A statistical test was applied in order to check for possible incompatiability between the asymmetry amplitudes extracted from both data sets. Only the statistical uncertainties were employed in this test. The results show that the two data sets are not incompatible. The $A_{\textrm{LU,I}}$, $A_{\textrm{LU,DVCS}}$ and $A_{\textrm{C}}$ asymmetry amplitudes can therefore be extracted from the complete hydrogen data set recorded during the entire experimental operation of H{\sc ermes}.

The results of the beam-helicity and beam-charge asymmetry amplitudes extracted from the complete 1996-2007 hydrogen sample are shown in Figs.~\ref{bsa_xbjrange} and \ref{bca_xbjrange}. The number of analysable events available from the 2006-2007 data set (67815) is approximately three times greater than the number \blue{of} events recorded in the 1996-2005 sample (24817). The  asymmetry amplitudes extracted from the complete 1996-2007 data set are thus weighted towards the 2006-2007 result. \blue{This is not so evident for the beam helicity asymmetry amplitudes} because the beam polarisation was lower in 2006 and 2007.

The first and second harmonics of $\mathcal{A}_{\textrm{LU,I}}$, which are
sensitive to the interference term in the scattering amplitude, are shown in the first and third rows of Fig.~\ref{bsa_xbjrange}. The leading-twist amplitude $A_{\textrm{LU,I}}^{\sin\phi}$ has the largest value of any of the amplitudes when extracted in a single bin from the entire data set. This amplitude has no strong dependence on $-t$, $x_{\textrm{B}}$ or $Q^{2}$, implying a strong dependence at smaller values of $-t$ as the amplitude must diminish \blue{in this $-t$ region} due to the dependence of the amplitude on the factor $k$ from Eq.~\ref{eq:s1}. The $A_{\textrm{LU,I}}^{\sin\phi}$ amplitude is sensitive to the imaginary part of the CFF $\mathcal{H}$ and thereby can constrain GPD $\textit{H}$. The twist-3 $A_{\textrm{LU,I}}^{\sin(2\phi)}$ amplitude \blue{is} compatible with zero, as \blue{is} the twist-3 $A_{\textrm{LU,DVCS}}^{\sin\phi}$ amplitude, which is dependent on the squared DVCS term. The $A_{\textrm{LU,DVCS}}^{\sin\phi}$ amplitudes are shown in the second row of Fig.~\ref{bsa_xbjrange}. Neither the $A_{\textrm{LU,DVCS}}^{\sin\phi}$ nor the $A_{\textrm{LU,I}}^{\sin(2\phi)}$ amplitude show any clear dependence on $-t$, $x_{\textrm{B}}$ or $Q^{2}$. The systematic error bands of the asymmetry amplitudes extracted from the combined data set were determined using Monte Carlo simulations that reflect the equipment used in the various stages of the H{\sc ermes} experiment. 

The $A_{\textrm{C}}^{\cos(n\phi)}$ amplitudes are shown in Fig.~\ref{bca_xbjrange}. The leading-twist $A_{\textrm{C}}^{\cos(0\phi)}$ and $A_{\textrm{C}}^{\cos\phi}$ amplitudes are both non-zero. There is a relationship between $A_{\textrm{C}}^{\cos(0\phi)}$ and $A_{\textrm{C}}^{\cos\phi}$ as the Fourier coefficient $c^{\textrm{I}}_{0,\textrm{UNP}}$ is inversely proportional to $c^{\textrm{I}}_{1,\textrm{UNP}}$ via the kinematic factor $k$ \blue{from} Eq.~\ref{eq:c1}. These amplitudes diverge with opposite sign from zero at increasing values of $-t$ but they
have no discernible dependence on $x_{\textrm{B}}$ and $Q^{2}$. The $A_{\textrm{C}}^{\cos(2\phi)}$ and $A_{\textrm{C}}^{\cos(3\phi)}$ amplitudes are both consistent with zero and have no significant variation in value over the range in $-t$, $x_{\textrm{B}}$ and $Q^{2}$. The amplitude $A_{C}^{\cos(2\phi)}$ is related to twist-3 GPDs and $A_{\textrm{C}}^{\cos(3\phi)}$ relates to gluon helicity-flip GPDs. Both of these amplitudes are expected to be suppressed at H{\sc ermes} kinematic conditions compared to the leading twist amplitudes.

The curves in Figs.~\ref{bsa_xbjrange} and~\ref{bca_xbjrange} show calculations from a global fit of GPDs to experimental data~\cite{Kum09}. The basic model is a minimalist dual representation of GPDs with only (very) weakly entangled \blue{skewness} and $t$ dependences. In the model, the $t$ dependence is approximated by a physically-motivated Regge dependence. The solid curves represent the model fit without data from experiments \cite{Cam06, Gir08} at Hall A in Jefferson Laboratory; the model fit represented by the dashed curves includes this data. Both fits include the 1996-2005 H{\sc ermes} data. The model incorporates only twist-2 GPDs and so can provide calculations only for the $A_{\textrm{LU,I}}^{\sin\phi}$, $A_{\textrm{C}}^{\cos(0\phi)}$ and $A_{\textrm{C}}^{\cos\phi}$ asymmetry amplitudes. \blue{All of the amplitudes are well described by the model.}

The asymmetry amplitudes shown in Figs.~\ref{bsa_xbjrange} and~\ref{bca_xbjrange} were also re-binned as a function of $-t$ for three different ranges of $x_{\textrm{B}}$. There was no observed dependence of any of the amplitudes with this two dimensional binning.
